## Demo accounts

- Admin: `admin@ridwaanstore.com` / `Admin123!`
- Customer: `demo@ridwaanstore.com` / `Demo123!`

Authentication and payments are front-end demonstrations stored in the browser with `localStorage`; they do not process real payments.

## Run locally

No dependencies or build process are required. Because service workers do not run reliably from `file://` URLs, use a local HTTP server when testing installation or offline PWA behavior.

From the repository folder, run either:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

or:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` for the Python server, or the URL printed by `serve`.

For a quick UI-only preview, you can still open `index.html` directly in a modern browser, but PWA installation and offline caching may be unavailable.

## Reset demo data

The demo saves accounts, cart items, orders, rewards, preferences and admin changes in the browser. To return the app to its original demo state, clear the site's stored data in the browser and reload the page.

In Chrome or Edge, open **Developer Tools → Application → Storage**, select **Clear site data**, then refresh. On a phone, clear the site's storage from the browser's site settings. This also removes the saved demo session, so sign in again with one of the demo accounts above.

## Deployment

This is a static site. On Vercel, use the project root as the root directory and leave the build command empty.

## Install on a phone

Open the live site in Chrome or Samsung Internet and tap **Install Mobile App**. If the browser does not show the prompt, open its menu and choose **Add to Home screen** or **Install app**.
